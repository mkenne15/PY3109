    "# Problem Set 3, Python question\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this question is to get you used to some of the more common features of AstroPy (https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/), along with familiarising you with python.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three parts to the problem:\n",
    "1. Given a star's spectrum and the transmission curves for 2 observing filters, calculate the star's apparent magnitudes in each filter. (6 marks).\n",
    "2. Given the parallax measurement for the star, estimate its distance, and the absolute magnitude of the star in each filter. Add these to the H-R diagram. (4 marks).\n",
    "3. Try identify the star, and briefly discuss it's position on the H-R diagram (1 mark).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "First off, Python is a modular coding languge. When you initially start a python session, there is very little in terms of functionality available to you. To import modules, we use the syntax\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "where this command imports the numpy module, and allows us to call any of it's functions using the np. syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also not want to load in an entire module, as they can some times be quite big, and include a lot of functionality which you don't need. A good example is Astropy. Good practice is to just import the sub-modules you need for you current project, which will save on time and memory. This is done using the syntax\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from astropy import units as u\n",
    "```\n",
    "where the above line imports the units module from astropy, and allows us to call it using u. The cell below loads in the modules and submodules we'll need for this exercise."
