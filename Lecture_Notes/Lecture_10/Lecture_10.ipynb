    "Now that we know the conditions required to form a star, it's time to turn our attention to the behaviour of matter and radiation within the stellar interior. We will largely be considering an ideal gas, and we'll need to pay attention to both quantum mechanical and special relativistic effects in our treatment."

    "Now, consider a photon which emerges from a nuclear burning core, as shown below. It encounters an atom at 1, interacts, and emerges at an angle, and moves to encounter another atom at position 2. This repeats until after atom 4. At this stage, the photon has travelled a long distance (summation of blue arrows), but relative to the core, has only moved slightly outwards (green arrow). After N number of interactions, it will finally escape into space - but how many interactions is this? And how long does it take?\n",

This also means the light we are seeing from the Sun is not a good indicator of what is currently going on in the core. More direct probes, like measuring the solar neutrino flux, can give us direct insight into the core."
