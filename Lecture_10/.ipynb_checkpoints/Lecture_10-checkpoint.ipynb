    "Now that we know the conditions required to form a star, it's time to turn our attention to the behaviour of matter and radiation within the stellar interior. We will largely be considering an ideal gas, and we'll need to pay attention to both quantum mechanical and special relativistic effects in our treatment."

    "First, let's consider particles in a cube with side $L$, such that $V=L^3$. The quantum states for particles confined with in this box can be given using a combination of standing waves of the form $\\sin(k_x x)+\\sin(k_y y)+\\sin(k_z z)$. This gives us the wave vector, ${\\bf k} = (k_x,k_y,k_z) = (n_x,n_y,n_z)\\pi/L$ where $n_x,n_y,n_z$ are all integers. ($n_x,n_y,n_z$) can be used to count the number of quantum states with differen wave vector. For example, $L/\\pi dk_x$ distance values of $n_x$ are available if $k_x$ increases to $k_x+dk_x$. Thus, the number of distinct quantum states between $(k_x,k_y,k_z)$ and $(k_x+dk_x,k_y+dk_y,k_z+dk_z)$ is:\n",
