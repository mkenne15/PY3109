    "This is pretty short compared to the age of the Galaxy. Also, ignoring pressure is not always a bad assumption - assuming that the internal energy within the cloud is lost as radiation, or absorbed into electrons transitioning between states, then the pressure within dust clouds can be kept very very low. Eventually, however, the cloud will become opaque to the radiation it is producing - at this point, we'll get a balance between in inward force of gravity and the outward force of pressure. This is known as Hydrostatic equilibrium."
