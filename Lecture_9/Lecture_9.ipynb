    "Using the Jeans Density, we found that for a 300 solar mass cloud, a density of $1\\times 10^6$ particles/m$^3$ is enough to drive a collapse. Such densities are such clouds typically follow a hierarchical collapse. In this model, one large cloud begins to collapse, driving up the density at various parts of the cloud until the cloud seperates into smaller clouds, with densities high enough to cause graviational collapse. This process continues until a single cloud produces several stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's assume we are at the final stage of this collapse - that is, we have a 1 solar mass dust cloud of molecular hydrogen at a temperature of 20 K, and an average density of:\n",

    "The radius of such a cloud is $\\sim 10^{15}$m. This cloud will collapse unopposed as long as the gravitational energy released is not converted into thermal motion of the particles. This will happen as long as the energy goes into dissassociation of hydrogen molecules and the ionization of H atoms.\n",

The kinetic energy of a classical electron is $E_{\\rm KE} = kT$, so the momentum is given by $p\\sim \\sqrt{2 m_{\\rm e} kT}$ (please excuse the mixing of classical and quantum here, but we just want to get a rough handle on the picture). As such, the De Broglie wavelength is\n",

The above approximateion predicts this should happen somewhere between 0.04 and 0.1 ${\\rm M_{\\odot}}$. A more detailed treatment shows this occurs when $M>0.06 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$.
