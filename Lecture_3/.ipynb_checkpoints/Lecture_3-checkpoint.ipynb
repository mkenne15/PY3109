    "While this system is independant of the rotation of the Earth because we are defining everything relative to a fixed point ($\\gamma$, the location at which the ecliptic intersects the celestial equator at the spring equinox), it is **not** independant of the precession of the Earth's axis. So, we must specify an epoch which the coordiantes are correct for. The most common epoch is the J2000 epoch, which uses a reference date of noon at Greenwich on January 1 2000. Whenan object coordinates are given with this epoch, they can then be precessed to match the current observation date. The other common reference epoch is B1950, which is midnight on January 1, 1950.\n",

    "## Proper motion\n",
    "Next, we consider the effects of a stars proper motion across the night sky. Consider an observer, and a star with velocity **v** as shown below. In spherical coordinates, this velocity has two components - a radial component, $v_{\\rm r}$, and an angular component $v_{\\rm \\theta}$. If we're tracking a stars position across the celestial sphere, then we are only measuring $v_{\\rm \\theta}$, which is known as the **transverse velocity**. Now, consider a time interval $\\Delta t$. Over this time, an object will have moved a distance $\\Delta d$ relative to our line of sight\n",

    "Consider an observer standing on the surface of the Earth. The point directly above the observer is known as the zenith, and the line which joins the North celestial pole with the celestial equator that passes directly over head is known as the meridian. Stars are easiest to observe as they pass through the Meridian, as at that point in time, there is a minimum in the atmospheric depth the starlight must pass through to reach the observer.\n",

The observer is at an latitude of $\\theta$. Any star which has a declination greater $90^{o}-\\theta$ will never set below the observers horizon (meaning they're always visible), while any star with a declination less than (-$90^{o}+\\theta$) will never rise (meaning they're never visible).\n",
