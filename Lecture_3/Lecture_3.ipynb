    "How do we convey the positions of stars in the night sky to people who are observing from a different place on the Earths surface, or who live at different time to us (and make sense of observations taken thousands of years ago)? Defining a coordinate system which accounts for the tilt and precession of the Earths spin axis relative to the Sun-Earth orbital plane is non-trivial, and in order to understand it, we must go back to the ancient Greeks."

    "#### Aside: Proper motion\n",
    "Next, we consider the effects of a stars proper motion across the night sky. Consider an observer, and a star with velocity **v** as shown below. In spherical coordinates, this velocity has two components - a radial component, $v_{\\rm r}$, and an angular component $v_{\\rm \\theta}$. If we're tracking a stars position across the celestial sphere, then we are only measuring $v_{\\rm \\theta}$, which is known as the **transverse velocity**. Now, consider a time interval $\\Delta t$. Over this time, an object will have moved a distance $\\Delta d$ relative to our line of sight\n",
